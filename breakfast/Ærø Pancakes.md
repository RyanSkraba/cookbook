## Ingredients:
* 1 pint of whole milk (or buttermilk if you have it)
* 25 grams of yeast
* 1lbs wheat flour
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 6 eggs
* 2 lbs lard for frying.

## Preparation:
- Warm the milk (room temp) and add the yeast
- Split the eggs and add only the yolks, one by one. Keep the whites
- Add in flour and salt
- Whisk the egg whites till fluffy, and slowly fold them into the batter.
- Put the batter aside for one hour to let it rise. Remember to use a BIG bowl!

## Baking:
- Make sure the pan is plenty full of lard, bake at a moderately high heat.
- Add 3 pancakes on the pan at a time (slightly smaller than american pancakes), bake on both sides till golden brown.
- Put them on a grease-absorbing paper and let them rest.

Best enjoyed with a plum compot (Zwetschkenröster!) or some such delicacy.
