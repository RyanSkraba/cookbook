# No-spread Gingerbread cookies

## Ingredients
* 1 stick unsalted butter
* 1/4 cup vegetable shortening (I use the butter-flavored Crisco)
* 1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
* 2/3 cup molasses
* 1 large egg

* 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon (I prefer the Penzey’s blend)
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
* 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
* 3/4 teaspoon ground allspice
* A few grinds of pepper (I use a Penzey’s blend of Tellicherry and white peppercorns)

## Directions
1. Start by beating the butter and shortening together, then cream in the brown sugar. If you do it on a lower speed, you’ll incorporate less air, which will help with the spreading problem when they’re baking. But leave it way longer than you think. Creaming butter and sugar takes several minutes. 
2. Add in the molasses and egg.
3. Sift in the dry ingredients. Or be lazy and just dump it in. I won't tell.
4. Wrap the ball of dough in plastic wrap and put it in the fridge.Leave it overnight or even the next day.
5. When you’re ready to roll it out, skip cleaning the counters or getting out the mat. Roll it out directly on the cookie sheet. Cut the cookies on the sheet, and you won’t have to try to move them without stretching them out of shape. Peel up the extra dough and repeat.
6. Put the sheets with the cookies back in the fridge for at least an hour until they’re good and cold again. T
7. Bake at 350°F for about 10 minutes. 
8. Bam. Cookies. Delicious. Eat.
