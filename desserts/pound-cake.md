# Pound cake

## Ingredients
* 1.5 cups butter (340 grams or 3 US sticks)
* 8 oz cream cheese
* 3 cups sugar (600 grams)
* 6 eggs
* 3 cups cake flour (340 grams)
* 2 tsp vanilla extract

**Note about cake flour: Without writing a dissertation on types of flour, if you don't have cake flour, put 2 tablespoons of cornstarch in a one-cup measuring cup, and then fill it with flour. That's a reasonable substitute for one cup of cake flour. 

## Directions
1. Cream the butter, cream cheese, and sugar. A long time. No grittiness left. If you don't usually cream butter and sugar, it takes way longer than you think. If you do often cream it, there's a good chance you're not doing it long enough. Do it longer. 
2. Add eggs, keep beating until they're well incorporated. 
3. Add the flour slowly. When it's all incorporated, add the vanilla and beat 30 more seconds. 
4. Grease your pan and bake at 325 F for 90 minutes. 

I strongly suggest using a tube pan with a removable bottom, but it will work in a Bundt pan or two loaf pans as well.
