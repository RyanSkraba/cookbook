OK, I know this sounds weird (ketchup?!) but it's delicious. The short version: 

Boil a chicken. Use some of the resulting broth and chicken. There's more than enough to make yourself some chicken and dumplings later. 
Cut 2-3 potatoes into 1" cubes (more if you like taters!) and boil them in the broth. 
Chop up some onions if you like them and toss them in. 
Once the potatoes are done, give it a hearty few squirts of ketchup. I use Nature's Seasons as well, which is basically salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder.
Serve over rice. 

When I first moved out, I asked my dad how to make it, and the longer version below is what he sent me. As you can see, none of us are very good at that "measurements" thing.
I don't remember bacon, cumin, coriander, or soy sauce ever being involved. I definitely don't use anywhere near a half bottle of ketchup unless I'm making a very large batch. But he's sort of a "whatever's closest, toss it in" kind of cook, so who knows?

========================================================

This is an old family recipe handed down (and improved upon) for more than 200 years. It's a family favorite for the old and young. Many ingredients can be modified. This is kind of a "whatever is handy now" recipe. You can use a whole roasting chicken cut into bite-sized pieces, or just breasts and thighs if you prefer. Since most modern families comprise closer to 3.5 people as compared to the 12 or more in the old days, this recipe has been adjusted to feed a family of four. I don't know how you can have half a person in the household, but if you do, just borrow half a person from next door and have food for a family of four. 

Ingredients

Go out into the barnyard and catch either the rooster that woke you early today or an old fat hen that's useless since she quit laying eggs and only sits around and eats. once you catch the chicken (watch out for the beak, it can hurt you if you are bitten), you must kill it. Catch the chicken by its neck, swing it around several times rapidly, and with a quick flip of the wrist, break its neck. This method is preferred to placing it on the chopping block, chopping off the head, and watching it flop around the yard for a few minutes. It's also less messy, but when the yard was dirt, it didn't make much difference. While you are catching and killing the chicken, have the children build a fire under the large black cast iron kettle and fill it with water. When the water boils, throw in the dead chicken. one minute should be long eonugh to make the feathers easy to pluck. Once plucked, there are two options for the feathers. Save them for a feather bed or throw them away, but do not burn them -- burned feathers smell horrible. 

Cut the chicken open and clean out the insides. Save the liver, heart, and gizzard, as they are good to eat later. Yard dogs like the rest of the remains. For those of you who are lazy or don't have a yard and live chickens, just go to your supermarket and buy a dressed chicken. If you're really lazy, buy one that is already cut up and save the time when yo uget home. When cutting up a whole chicken, use a sharp knife and a cleaver and cut it into large pieces. 

Up until 40 or 50 years ago, you would have had fresh vegetables in your garden, or as a city dweller, would have bought them from a produce vendor. In the interest of time and space, I'll assume you're going to a supermarket and buying your vegetables. Hop into the family SUV and head down to the new ultra-large megasupermarket and spend as much time finding a parking space, searching for the vegetables in the megastore, and growing old while standing in the checkout line as you would have spent if you'd grown them fresh. The following ingredients should be purchased: 

- bottle of tomato ketchup -- replaces fresh, homemade tomato ketchup
- bag of potatoes -- cheap bag of small white potatoes are close to homegrown. Some old recipes used turnips. 
- bag of onions -- regular yellow "makes you cry" onions. 
- pound of bacon -- Do not buy if you have a smokehouse. Lots of good pork products at fall hog killing time. 
- rice -- usually purchased in bulk since only a few parts of the deep South grew rice. 
- red peppers -- homegrown, dried, and crushed are best, but a can of crushed red pepper or a bottle of hot sauce will do. 
- spices -- If you do not have the following, they should be purchase: salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce, red wine vinegar, soy sauce. 

Prepare all ingredients as follows:

1. Chicken: Cut into large pieces. 
2. Potatoes: Peel and cut into 1" cubes. Save skins for potato soup. 
3. Onions: Chop into small pieces. Cry. 
4. Bacon: Cut bacon strips into 1/2" pieces. 
5. Set all spices on the counter. 

Build a fire in the wood burning stove. Place a big cooking pot on the stove. 

In a large skillet with a tight-fitting lid, cook bacon over medium high heat. When bacon is crisp, remove bacon and add the chicken. Brown quickly. Remove chicken from pan. Reduce heat to medium low. Add onion and potato to the pan, saute for 2-3 minutes. Season with any available spices, such as cumin, coriander, black pepper, red pepper, and salt. 

Fill pot with water and add browned chicken, bacon, potatoes, onions, and any accumulated juices. Place lid on skillet and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10-15 minutes. Place lid on pot and allow to simmer for an hour or more or until chicken is cooked through and potatoes are tender. 

Add ketchup to taste -- as much as half a bottle. Potatoes will not cook after the ketchup is added. Cook on low for 15-30 minutes. 

Cook the rice while you wait. Two cups of water to one cup of rice, and salt to taste. 

Remove from heat, adjust seasoning, and serve over rice.
