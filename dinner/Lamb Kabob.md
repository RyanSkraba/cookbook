# fluxo's lamb kabobs

## Ingredients
    * 1/4 cup (60 mL) extra virgin olive oil
    * 3-5 pounds (approx 2kg) boneless leg of lamb
    * three green bell peppers (capsicum)
    * 1-2 tsp (approx 10g) coarse salt 
    * 1-2 tsp (approx 5g) black pepper to taste
    * 1-2 sprigs fresh mexican or greek oregano (a pinch of dried italian works too) - this is optional but recommended
    * 1/2 tsp (1-2g) of sumac (optional, can be hard to find)

## Grill setup
    * High direct heat for searing and charring

## Instructions
1. Dice bell pepper into approximately 1" (2-3cm) chunks
1. Mince oregano
1. Cut lamb into 1-2" (2-5cm) chunks, trimming excess fat and gristle. The more time you spend trimming fat and gristle here, the more tender your kabob will be.
1. Mix everything in a large vessel. Cover, refrigerate at least 8 hours, preferably overnight. Stir occasionally.
1. Thread lamb and peppers on metal skewers. Try to maintain an even distribution of lamb and pepper per skewer. Wooden skewers can be used, just be sure to soak them for at least an hour prior to use.
1. Over high heat, grill kabobs until lamb is medium rare and vegetables are charred and soft. 
1. Serve over rice or with pita.
