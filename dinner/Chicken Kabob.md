# fluxo's chicken kabobs

## Ingredients
    * 1/4 cup (60 mL) extra virgin olive oil
    * juice of one lemon
    * zest of one lemon
    * 2-3 pounds (approx 1kg) boneless skinless chicken thighs
    * one large white or yellow onion
    * two red, yellow, or orange bell peppers (capsicum)
    * 6-8 cloves garlic, crushed and minced
    * 1-2 tsp (approx 10g) coarse salt 
    * 1-2 tsp (approx 5g) black pepper to taste
    * 1-2 sprigs fresh mexican or greek oregano (a pinch of dried italian works too) - this is optional but recommended

## Grill setup
    * High direct heat for searing and charring
    * Low/medium indirect heat for roasting

## Instructions
1. Dice onion and bell pepper into approximately 1" (2-3cm) chunks
1. Cut chicken thighs into 2-3 pieces per thigh, removing excess fat and gristle
1. Mix everything in a large vessel. Cover, refrigerate at least 8 hours, preferably overnight. Stir occasionally.
1. Thread chicken, peppers, and onions on metal skewers. Try to maintain an even distribution of chicken, pepper, and onion on each kabob. Wooden skewers can be used, just be sure to soak them for at least an hour prior to use.
1. Over high heat, grill kabobs until chicken is browned and vegetables are slightly charred (5-10 minutes)
1. Over indirect heat, allow the chicken to continue cooking until the peppers and onions are soft and sweet, and the chicken is no longer pink inside (approx 20 minutes)
1. Serve over rice or with pita.
