# Impossible Quiche

The neat thing about this quiche is that you don't have to build a separate pie shell. The flour in the mixture settles to the bottom of the pie plate and forms the shell during the baking process.

## Ingredients
* Wet
    * 4 eggs
    * 2 cups of milk / chicken broth / other liquid (only a dash of red wine or other alcoholic liquid)
    * 1/4 cup melted butter
* Dry
    * All the cool stuff you want in your quiche:
      * crumbled cooked bacon
      * shredded cheese
      * sauteed mushrooms
      * lightly-fried onion
      * shrimp
      * sliced apples
      * broccoli
      * peppers
    * 1/4 tsp salt
    * 1/8 tsp pepper
    * 1/2 cup flour

## Instructions
1. Grease 10" pie plate.
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
1. Mix the wet ingredients together in one bowl; the salt, pepper, and flour together in another.
1. Distribute all the cool stuff evenly in the pie plate. If you feel you have gotten a bit carried away on the cool stuff, increase the other ingredients by 50% or 100% so you have enough batter to cover everything else. You may need to move to a larger pan to hold everything!
1. Add the wet ingredients into the dry and mix well until you have a smooth batter.
1. Pour the batter over the cool stuff in the pie plate so that most of everything is submerged.
1. Bake for 55 minutes, or until the center of the pie is firm.
1. Let stand for ten minutes before serving.
